# Our Purpose: Accelerate Interpretability Research

Interpretability is an unsolved problem - anyone that tells you otherwise is either trying to sell you something and/or misinformed - especially with new models being released so frequently.

And while it's certainly possible that advanced AI is somehow "naturally aligned" to be pro-human and pro-Earth, there's no benefit to assuming that this is true. It also seems unlikely that all advanced AI would be _fully_ aligned in the various possible scenarios and edge cases.

Neuronpedia's role is to accelerate understanding of AI models, so that when they get powerful enough, we have a better chance of aligning them. If we can increase the probability of a good outcome by even 0.01%, that's an expected value of saving many current and future lives - certainly a worthwhile and meaningful endeavor.

# How We Got Here: A Brief History

Neuronpedia was created in the summer of 2023 as a reference for GPT2-Small's neurons, using data and [code](https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/neuron-explainer/neuron-viewer/index.html) from OpenAI's [Superalignment](https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/) initiative and informally advised by William Saunders. Combined with Neel Nanda's [Neuroscope](https://neuroscope.io/gpt2-small/index.html), we tried to answer the question: **how do you create a useful interpretability platform?**

One early experiment was crowdsourcing human explanations for neurons. By [using LLMs to score](https://openai.com/index/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models/) explanations, the hope was to make fine-tuned models that could accurately explain neurons. This became a full-fledged graphical RPG:

    Neuronpedia collected over 10,000 user-submitted explanations, half of which scored higher than GPT-4.

However, the game, while interesting, was not the most impactful use of an interpretability platform - it was catering to one facet of a specific research question. We wanted to serve more researchers and their various areas of interest.

So in early 2024, thanks to the direction of [Joseph Bloom](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BaEQoxHhWPrkinmxd/announcing-neuronpedia-platform-for-accelerating-research), Neuronpedia sunset its game and went all-in on accelerating interpretability researchers, including hosting the world's first interpretability and steering API. We've since then collaborated with [independent](https://www.neuronpedia.org/sae-bench/info) [researchers](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2sm-tres-dc), [large](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gemma-scope#main) [organizations](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2sm-oai-2024), [and](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2sm-apollojt) [academic](https://www.neuronpedia.org/axbench) [research](https://www.neuronpedia.org/llama3.1-8b-eleuther_gp) [labs](https://www.neuronpedia.org/llama-scope).

# Why Open Source Now?

It takes a significant amount of effort to make an app like Neuronpedia (frontend, backend, infrastructure, dependent services) ready for open source - there are considerations of security, backward compatibility, extensibility, etc. Not to mention, the database schema and architecture was changing significantly from week to week.

Two months ago, we decided that the longer-term benefits of open sourcing outweighed the short-term priority of quickly adding new functionalities, so we put most major changes on hiatus and focused on refactoring, cleaning up, and documenting code/processes for open sourcing. Over the next few weeks, we'll keep adding more features/guides for running, customizing, and extending Neuronpedia.

# What Do You Get From an Open Source Neuronpedia?

## New: Host Neuronpedia Yourself

Want to make not-neuronpedia.org? It's as simple as a few clicks. And you can `git pull` new changes when we deploy them, to stay updated with the latest fixes/features.

You can now host Neuronpedia yourself, with your own model and data, on your own cloud or hardware. And you can choose to make it public or private. For example - did you train new sparse coders on a particular dataset? You can load that into a local database and access all of Neuronpedia's features, like an API, steering, dashboards, search, lists, and more.

## New: Fork Neuronpedia For Research, Projects, and Startups

We're grateful for the people and organizations that came before us to make Neuronpedia possible, and we're happy to have lit the fire to inspire various projects, both public and private. Now, you can customize Neuronpedia to your heart's content - changing everything from updating colors to adding new features.

Neuronpedia is comprised of multiple services that can run independently, so you can also just fork parts of Neuronpedia that you want and replace other parts entirely. For example, if you want just the frontend of Neuronpedia but plug in a different system for inference, just replace the Neuronpedia inference server, ensuring that your new inference server matches the defined OpenAPI spec.

**Subpoint: Applied Interpretability**

It's important to highlight that this opens up many possibilites for applied interpretability projects, both safety-related and not. For example, we have previously experimented with building "Safety Dashboards" for specific models - with just a few tweaks to the steering interface, we built a prototype red-teaming "Safety Dashboard", which could have been easily extended to specific topics like deception and violence.

## New: Contributing Code to the Global Neuronpedia

With every research collaboration, Neuronpedia adds new functionality for everyone to use - not just that specific research project. For example, when we added [AxBench](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gemma-2-9b-it/20-axbench-reft-r1-res-16k/2), we added the ability to explore and search "concepts", an alternative to SAE features.

But collaborations like that don't scale well because they're bottlenecked on our engineering resources, as well as time to communicate and verify implementations with the researcher. By open sourcing, we can focus on our respective strengths - the researcher can implement technical parts related to their project, and we fill in the gaps for UI, scaling, etc where needed. Finally, merging this to the global [neuronpedia.org](https://neuronpedia.org) enables everyone to benefit.

**Subpoint: Using AI Assist and Coding Agents**

We're optimistic about using AI coding agents to accelerate the development of new features for Neuronpedia, and encourage you to try it. We've added some [Cursor Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) files to give AI the proper context, and have done some early experiments to gauge AI capability in adding new functionality to Neuronpedia.

For example, the "Orthogonal Projection" steering type (an alternative to "Simple Additive") was created with a few prompts, with minimal human fixes. It's likely adding more READMEs, Cursor Rules, and a bit more refactoring will help improve AI agent development significantly.

## New: Roadmap (WIP) + Public Feature Requests

You can submit feature requests, bug reports, and questions on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/hijohnnylin/neuronpedia/issues).

We're currently working on porting our TODOs and roadmap from our private task management lists, to our GitHub issues and [discussions](https://github.com/hijohnnylin/neuronpedia/discussions). GitHub is also the place where we'll list known issues and workarounds.

## New: Add Data to the Global Datasets (WIP)

Let's say you came up with a new type of sparse coder, called the Sparse PuppyEncoder (SPE), and you want to not only [host it yourself](#new-host-neuronpedia-yourself), but also to let others load Sparse PuppyEncoders (and your generated data) into _their own_ local Neuronpedia and tinker with it? You can do that, too - just use the `neuronpedia-utils` export tools to export your activations, explanations, and metadata. Then, we upload your data to the public [neuronpedia-datasets](https://neuronpedia-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=v1/), so that anyone running a local instance can import it.

# What Does Open Sourcing _Not_ Change?

## Unchanged: Supporting the Newest Interpretability Research

A key to Neuronpedia is moving quickly to adopt the latest in interpretability science - and updating our interfaces, schemas, and APIs to match. Nothing changes about our own development of new Neuronpedia features - we have a long list of functionalities we're itching to get back to adding and fixing.

What slightly changes is that we'll be more cautious and better document significant changes, especially with database schema updates, to ensure stability for other instances of Neuronpedia.

## Unchanged: We're Still Your Collaborator

By open sourcing Neuronpedia, we make it easier for researchers to get a head start on changes they wish to add or make to Neuronpedia. However, we fully expect that in the near term, while the documentation is still getting fleshed out, that we'll still do the majority of the work in building out collaborations. There's still work for us to do in restructuring Neuronpedia to be more easily extensible for someone not intimately familiar with the codebase.
